# Hexbloop Deprecation Fixes

## Background
Hexbloop has multiple errors related to deprecated APIs in macOS 13.0 and 15.0, primarily in the MacAudioEngine and AVFoundation components.

## Issues
1. Deprecated AVAsset/AVAssetExportSession methods in macOS 13.0 and 15.0
2. Non-sendable type capture in @Sendable closure
3. Missing type members in AVMetadataIdentifier
4. Unreachable catch block in ContentView

## Tasks
- Update AVAsset initialization to use AVURLAsset(url:)
- Replace isExportable with load(.isExportable)
- Replace tracks(withMediaType:) with loadTracks(withMediaType:)
- Fix @Sendable closure issues with AVAssetExportSession
- Replace status checks with states(updateInterval:)
- Replace export() with async/await pattern
- Fix AVMetadataIdentifier.id3MetadataPictureType reference
- Correct ContentView error handling

## Pending Compatibility Fixes
The audio processing pipeline has been updated to improve compatibility with future macOS versions, but still needs additional work for macOS 15.0 compatibility:

1. The `AudioProcessingOptimizer` needs to use modern async APIs exclusively
2. The `MacAudioEngine` class should use async/await methods for metadata handling
3. Handle AVFoundation's transition to Swift concurrency models

## Mac App Store Requirements
For successful Mac App Store submission:

1. Remove any direct dependencies on FFmpeg (current implementation makes it optional)
2. Use AVFoundation exclusively for audio processing in the default configuration
3. Ensure proper sandboxing for file operations
4. Handle all permission requests appropriately
5. Respect App Transport Security for any network operations

## Testing Approach
1. Test on macOS 12.0, 13.0, 14.0, and 15.0 beta
2. Verify processing works with and without FFmpeg present
3. Test with various audio formats (MP3, WAV, M4A, AIFF)
4. Verify batch processing with multiple files
5. Check artwork generation and embedding
