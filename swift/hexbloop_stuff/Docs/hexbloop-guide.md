## About the Project

Hexbloop is inspired by an original bash script for audio processing and naming. It takes the core idea - transforming unnamed audio into stylized, finished tracks - and expands it with a proper macOS app interface, enhanced processing, and artwork generation.

The app honors the aesthetic of the original script while making the workflow more accessible and adding visual elements to complement the audio experience.
